An extremely simple websocket server that broadcasts all messages it
receives to all clients.

The only dependency is `ws` to keep it as minimal as possible.

Use for experimental games, chat applications, etc.

Supports "rooms": clients connected to the same URL, such as
ws://localhost:7777/game9283, only see clients that connected to the
same url.

Usage:

./run

If you want to run in a different port,

WSBROADCAST_PORT=1234 ./run
